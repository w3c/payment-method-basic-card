      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines the "basic-card" payment method for use, for
        instance, with the <a data-cite="payment-request">Payment Request
        API</a>. With it, merchants can request the card details (card holder
        name, card number, etc.) from the end user as an alternative to
        collecting the same information through a [[!HTML]] form.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic card payment method provides information to merchant websites
        that can be used for multiple transactions over a potentially very long
        period of time, typically on the order of several years at a time. At
        the time of the development of this specification, it is commonplace
        for merchant sites to store this information long-term to reduce the
        friction of a user entering a credit card number for every future
        purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision whether to retain credit card information for future
        transactions remains a matter of local policy for web sites; however,
        the introduction of a programmatic way to retrieve credit card
        information from a web browser affects some key factors that typically
        motivate storage of such information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the web browser will retain credit card information, and make
        it available – subject to user approval – whenever a merchant needs it,
        the friction that merchants seek to avoid is reduced. This can also
        potentially reduce some liability considerations of storing information
        on a persistent basis, such as financial liability that can result from
        unauthorized access to the databases used to store credit card
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, web sites that call the <a data-cite=
        "payment-request">Payment Request API</a> for each transaction avoid
        the friction that can result when users’ credit card numbers and/or
        expiration dates are updated. From a user’s perspective, this avoids
        the hassle of having to update a large number of merchant web sites any
        time they are issued a new card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, by letting the web browser determine user authentication
        information, the merchant site is relieved of the duty of ensuring that
        a time-local and sufficiently strong authentication has occurred.
        Additionally, payment handlers can make use of local affordances, such
        as biometrics and hardware tokens, to authenticate users in a way that
        is more convenient, more secure, and lower friction than web sites
        currently can.

      <h2>
        Model
      </h2>
      <p>
        This section defines concepts used in this specification, and how those
        concepts are represented in an API via [[!WEBIDL]].
      </p>
      <p>
        A <dfn>card</dfn> is a physical or virtual payment instrument that has
        <a>details</a>, a <a>type</a>, and belongs to a <a>network</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>details</dfn> of a <a>card</a> are the <dfn data-cite=
        "!ISO7812-1">primary account number</dfn> (PAN), <dfn>card holder's
        name</dfn>, <dfn>security code</dfn> (sometimes known as the CVV, CVC,
        CVN, CVE or CID), <dfn>expiry month</dfn>, <dfn>expiry year</dfn>, and
        optionally a <dfn>billing address</dfn>. These are represented as the
        members of the <a>BasicCardResponse</a> dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>card</a> can be of <dfn data-lt="types">type</dfn> "credit",
        "debit", or "prepaid", as derived from the issuer identification number
        (the first eight digits of the <a>primary account number</a>). The
        different types are represented as the <a>BasicCardType</a> enum.
      </p>
      <aside class="note" title="Determining the card type">
        <p>
          Commercial databases and web services are available to look up issuer
          identification numbers, which in turn return the <a>type</a> of card.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        A <a>card</a> is identified as belonging to a <dfn data-lt=
        "networks">network</dfn> via its issuer identification number
        [[!ISO7812-1]] (e.g., those belonging to "visa" start with a "4"). In
        an API, each network is represented by a string matching one of the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/card-network-ids">card network
        identifiers</a> [[!card-network-ids]].
      </p>
      <aside class="note" title="Common issuer identification numbers (IIN)">
        <p>
          Issuer identification numbers (IIN) are maintained by ISO but are not
          available to the general public. However, Wikipedia maintains a list
          of the common <a href=
          "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Payment_card_number#Issuer_identification_number_.28IIN.29">
          credit card issuer identification numbers</a>.
        </p>
      </aside>
      <p>
        A payment handler's <dfn data-lt="known">known networks</dfn> are
        <a>networks</a> it supports. A payment handler MAY support zero or more
        networks from the [[!card-network-ids]] list.

        In particular, merchants need to treat the values of any <a>details</a>
        with the same scrutiny that they would apply to a [[HTML]]
        <code>input</code> element, by, for example, sanitizing all the members
        of a <a>BasicCardResponse</a> before rendering them anywhere.

        Owners of web sites SHOULD NOT store the payer's card information
        except where warranted, such as storage for future and recurring
        payments. When card information is stored, web site owners SHOULD take
        measures to prevent its disclosure.

        Depending on jurisdiction, users of this specification (implementers,
        merchants, payment processors, etc.) can be subject to <abbr class=
        "Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard">PCI DSS</abbr> or other
        regulations. Discussion of those considerations are outside the scope
        of this document.
