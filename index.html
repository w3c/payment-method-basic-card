      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification is a Payment Method specification for use with the PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]].
        With it, merchants can collect the basic card details (card holder name, card number, etc.) through the
        PaymentRequest API that they have traditionally collected through Web forms, but with an improved user experience.</p>
      <p class="note">The Web Payments Working Group is also investigating payment methods that offer greater security (e.g., through tokenization).</p>

        The <code>supportedNetworks</code> and <code>supportedTypes</code> fields are both optional.

      <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>The basic card payment method provides information to merchant
      websites that can be used for multiple transactions over a potentially
      very long period of time, typically on the order of several years at a
      time. At the time of the development of this specification, it is
      commonplace for merchant sites to store this information long-term to
      reduce the friction of a user entering a credit card number for every
      future purchase.</p>

      <p>The decision whether to retain credit card information for future
      transactions remains a matter of local policy for web sites; however,
      the introduction of a programmatic way to retrieve credit card
      information from a web browser changes a couple of key factors that
      typically motivate storage of such information.</p>

      <p>Because the web browser will retain credit card information, and make
      it available – subject to user approval – whenever a merchant needs it,
      the friction that merchants seek to avoid no longer exists. This frees
      merchants from the liability considerations of storing information on a
      persistent basis, such as financial liability that can result from
      unauthorized access to the databases used to store credit card
      information.</p>

      <p>Additionally, web sites that call the payments API for each
      transaction avoid the friction that can result when users’ credit card
      numbers and/or expiration dates are updated. From a user’s perspective,
      this avoids the hassle of having to update a large number of merchant
      web sites any time they are issued a new card.</p>

      <p>Finally, by letting the web browser determine user authentication
      information, the merchant site is relieved of the duty of ensuring that
      a time-local and sufficiently strong authentication has occurred.
      Additionally, browsers can make use of local affordances, such as
      biometrics and hardware tokens, to authenticate users in a way that is
      more convenient, more secure, and lower friction than web sites
      currently can.</p>

      <p>The basic card payment method provides information to requesting
      websites that can be used for multiple transactions over a potentially
      very long period of time, typically on the order of several years at a
      time.  The decision whether to retain credit card information for future
      transactions is a matter of local policy for web sites.</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Implementers may be subject to PCI DSS or other regulations, but discussion of those considerations lies outside the scope of this document.</p>
