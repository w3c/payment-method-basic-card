        This specification describes data structures and formats, and a simple
        processing model, to facilitate card-based payments on the Web. It is
        used by other specifications to facilitate monetary transactions with a
        "basic card", such as credit, debit, or prepaid card.

        Introduction

      <p>
        This specification defines the "basic-card" payment method for use, for
        instance, with the <a data-cite="payment-request">Payment Request
        API</a>. With it, merchants can collect the basic card details (card
        holder name, card number, etc.) as an alternative to collecting the
        same information through a [[!HTML]] form.

        The <a data-cite=
        "!payment-method-id#standardized-payment-method-identifiers">standardized
        payment method identifier</a> for this specification is
        "<code><dfn>basic-card</dfn></code>".

        Model
      </h2>
      <p>
        A <dfn>card</dfn> is a payment instrument that has <a>details</a>, a
        <a>type</a>, a <a>network</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <dfn>details</dfn> of a <a>card</a> are the <dfn>primary account
        number</dfn> (PAN), <dfn>card-holder's name</dfn>, <dfn>security
        code</dfn> (sometimes known as the CVV, CVC, CVN, CVE or CID),
        <dfn>expiry month</dfn>, <dfn>expiry year</dfn>, and optionally a
        <dfn>billing address</dfn>. These are represented as the members of the
        <a>BasicCardResponse</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>card</a> can be of <dfn data-lt="types">type</dfn> "credit",
        "debit", or "prepaid". The different types are represented as the
        <a>BasicCardType</a> enum.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>card</a> is identified as belonging to a <dfn data-lt=
        "networks">network</dfn> via its issuer identification number (e.g.,
        those belonging to "visa" start with a "4"). In an API, each network is
        represented by a DOMString matching one of the <a href=
        "https://www.w3.org/Payments/card-network-ids">card network
        identifiers</a> [[!card-network-ids]].
      </p>
      <p>
        A payment handler's <dfn data-lt="known">known networks</dfn> are
        <a>networks</a> it supports. A payment handler MAY support zero or more
        networks from the [[!card-network-ids]] list.

      <p>
        The <dfn>steps to constrain a payment handler</dfn> with
        <var>data</var> <a>BasicCardRequest</a> are given by the following
        algorithm. If the end-user inputs or selects a <a>card</a> that meets
        the constraints of <var>data</var>, the algorithm returns a card as a
        <a>BasicCardResponse</a>.

        Security and Privacy Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Due to differences in "quality of implementation", and the end-user's
        ability to input data into unconstrained input fields, merchants are
        expected to revalidate all <a>BasicCardResponse</a> returned by APIs
        that make use of this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, merchants need to treat the values of any <a>details</a>
        with the same scrutiny that they would apply to a [[HTML]]
        <code>input</code> element, by, for example, sanitizing all the members
        of a <a>BasicCardResponse</a> before rendering them anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Owners of web sites SHOULD NOT store the payer's card information
        except where warranted, such as storage for future and recurring
        payments. When card information is stored, web site owners SHOULD take
        measures to prevent its disclosure.
      </p>
      <p class="note" title=
      "Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Compliance">
        Depending on jurisdiction, users of this specification (implementers,
        merchants, payment processors, etc.) can be subject to <abbr class=
        "Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard">PCI DSS</abbr> or other
        regulations. Discussion of those considerations are outside the scope
