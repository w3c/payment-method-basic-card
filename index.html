        The Basic Card Payment specification describes the data formats used by the
        PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] to support payment by payment cards such as
        credit or debit cards.
      </p>

      <p>
        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/webpayments-methods-card/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification was derived from a report published previously by the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification is a <a>Payment Transaction Message Specification</a> used by the PaymentRequest API
        [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] to support payment by payment cards such as credit or debit cards. It is intended
        to provide compatibility for merchants who currently request card details from customers to ease adoption
        of the PaymentRequest API.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, merchants should favor payment methods that provide a tokenized response rather than
        clear text credit card details.

      <h2>Payment Method Specific Data for the PaymentRequest constructor</h2>
      <p>This section describes payment method specific data that is supplied as part of the <code>data</code>
      argument to the PaymentRequest constructor.</p>
      <p>There is no payment method specific data used by the PaymentRequest constructor when processing
      Basic Card Payment methods.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="response">
      <h2>Payment Method Response</h2>
      <p>The <dfn><code>BasicCardResponse</code></dfn> dictionary contains the response from the
      PaymentRequest API when a user accepts payment with a Basic Payment Card payment method.</p>

      <section>
      <h2>BasicCardResponse</h2>
      <pre class="idl">
        dictionary BasicCardResponse {
          DOMString cardholderName;

          BillingAddress? billingAddress;
        };

      <p>
        The <code>BasicCardResponse</code> dictionary contains the following fields:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardholderName</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardholderName</code> field contains the cardholder's name as it appears on the card.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardNumber</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardNumber</code> field contains the primary account number (PAN) for the payment card.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>expiryMonth</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>expiryMonth</code> field contains a two-digit string for the expiry month
        of the card in the range <code>01</code> to <code>12</code>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>expiryYear</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>expiryYear</code> field contains a two-digit string for the expiry year
        of the card in the range <code>00</code> to <code>99</code>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardSecurityCode</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardSecurityCode</code> field contains a three or four digit string for the
        security code of the card (sometimes known as the CVV, CVC, CVN, CVE or CID).</dd>
		
      </dl>

      <p class="issue" title="Should we standardize a way for messages to implement field-level encryption?">
There is a requirement for payment apps to be able to return data that is
hidden from the payee themselves (perhaps for PCI scope reasons) as they will
pass it on to their payment service processor who can then decrypt it and use
it.
      </p>

      </section>

      <section>
      <h2>BillingAddress</h2>
      <pre class="idl">
        dictionary BillingAddress {
          // [...] fields TBC - most likely the same as shipping address
        };
      </pre>

      <p>The <dfn><code>BillingAddress</code></dfn> dictionary contains the billing address
      information associated with the payment card.</p>

      <p class="issue">
        The fields of the <code>BillingAddress</code> will most likely match those in the 
        shipping address of the PaymentRequest API once those are defined.
