      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification is a Payment Method specification for use with the PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]].
        With it, merchants can collect the basic card details (card holder name, card number, etc.) through the
        PaymentRequest API that they have traditionally collected through Web forms, but with an improved user experience.</p>
      <p class="note">The Web Payments Working Group is also investigating payment methods that offer greater security (e.g., through tokenization).</p>

      <p>
      This specification relies on several other underlying specifications.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Payment Request API</dt>
        <dd>The terms <dfn>PaymentRequest constructor</dfn>, <dfn>PaymentAddress</dfn>, and <dfn>validate payment method data algorithm</dfn>
        are defined by the PaymentRequest API specification [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]].</dd>
        <dt>Payment Method Identifiers</dt>

        [[!METHOD-IDENTIFIERS]].</dd>
        <dt>Web IDL</dt>
        <dd>The IDL in this specification is defined by Web IDL. Additionally, the algorithm for <dfn data-lt="convert to dictionary">converting an ECMAScript object to a dictionary</dfn> is defined there. [[!WEBIDL]]</dd>
      </dl>
    </section>

    <section id="method-id">
      <h2>Payment Method Identifier</h2>
      <p>The <a>payment method identifier</a> string for the Basic Card Payment method is <dfn><code>basic-card</code></dfn>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="request">
      <h2>Payment Method Specific Data for the PaymentRequest constructor</h2>
      <p>This section describes payment method specific data that is supplied as part of the <code>data</code>
      argument to the <a>PaymentRequest constructor</a>.</p>

      <p>The <a>validate payment method data algorithm</a> for the Basic Card payment method is to <a data-lt="convert to dictionary">convert</a> the ECMAScript object represented by the given data to a <a>BasicCardRequest</a> dictionary. This will throw an appropriate exception if the given data is not in the correct format.</p>

      <section>
      <h3>BasicCardRequest</h3>
      <pre class="idl">
        enum BasicCardType { "credit", "debit", "prepaid" };

        dictionary BasicCardRequest {
          sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; supportedNetworks;
          sequence&lt;BasicCardType&gt; supportedTypes;
        };
      </pre>

      <p>
        The <code>BasicCardRequest</code> dictionary contains the following fields:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn><code>supportedNetworks</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>supportedNetworks</code> field contains a sequence of identifiers for card networks
        that the merchant accepts. W3C maintains a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/card-network-ids">list of approved card network identifiers</a>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>supportedTypes</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>supportedTypes</code> field contains a sequence of card types that the merchant
        accepts. Implementations will determine how to match the type values <code>credit</code>,
        <code>debit</code>, and <code>prepaid</code>.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p class="note">
        The <code>supportedNetworks</code> and <code>supportedTypes</code> fields are both optional.
        If neither is provided then any card may be returned. If only <code>supportedNetworks</code>
        is provided then any card type may be returned provided it matches one of the networks.
        If only <code>supportedTypes</code> is provided then a card may be returned from any network
        provided it matches one of the types.

    <section id="response">
      <h2>Payment Method Response</h2>
      <p>The <dfn><code>BasicCardResponse</code></dfn> dictionary contains the response from the

      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardholderName</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardholderName</code> field contains the cardholder's name as it appears on the card.</dd>

        <dd>The <code>expiryMonth</code> field contains a two-digit string for the expiry month

        <dd>The <code>cardSecurityCode</code> field contains a three or four digit string for the

    <section id="security">
      <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>Owners of web sites SHOULD NOT store the payer's card information except where warranted, such as storage for future and recurring payments. When card information is stored, web site owners SHOULD take measures to prevent its disclosure.</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Implementers may be subject to PCI DSS or other regulations, but discussion of those considerations lies outside the scope of this document.</p>
