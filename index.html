      <h2>
        Introduction
      </h2>
      <p>
        This specification defines the "basic-card" payment method for use, for
        instance, with the [[[payment-request]]]. With it, merchants can
        request the card <a>details</a> (card holder name, card number, etc.)
        from the end user as an alternative to collecting the same information
        through a [^form^].
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic card payment method provides information to merchant websites
        that can be used for multiple transactions over a potentially very long
        period of time, typically on the order of several years at a time. At
        the time of the development of this specification, it is commonplace
        for merchant sites to store this information long-term to reduce the
        friction of a user entering a credit card number for every future
        purchase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The decision whether to retain credit card information for future
        transactions remains a matter of local policy for web sites; however,
        the introduction of a programmatic way to retrieve credit card
        information from a web browser affects some key factors that typically
        motivate storage of such information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the web browser will retain credit card information, and make
        it available – subject to user approval – whenever a merchant needs it,
        the friction that merchants seek to avoid is reduced. This can also
        potentially reduce some liability considerations of storing information
        on a persistent basis, such as financial liability that can result from
        unauthorized access to the databases used to store credit card
        information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, web sites that call the [[[payment-request]]] for each
        transaction avoid the friction that can result when users’ credit card
        numbers and/or expiration dates are updated. From a user’s perspective,
        this avoids the hassle of having to update a large number of merchant
        web sites any time they are issued a new card.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, by letting the web browser determine user authentication
        information, the merchant site is relieved of the duty of ensuring that
        a time-local and sufficiently strong authentication has occurred.
        Additionally, payment handlers can make use of local affordances, such
        as biometrics and hardware tokens, to authenticate users in a way that
        is more convenient, more secure, and lower friction than web sites
        currently can.

        A <dfn data-lt="card's">card</dfn> is a physical or virtual payment

        <a>network</a>.

        The <dfn>details</dfn> of a <a>card</a> are the <dfn data-abbr=

        CVN, CVE or CID), <dfn>expiry month</dfn>, <dfn>expiry year</dfn>, and
        optionally a <dfn>billing address</dfn>. These are represented as the
        members of the {{BasicCardResponse}} dictionary.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a>card</a> is identified as belonging to a <dfn>network</dfn> via
        its issuer identification number [[ISO7812-1]] (e.g., those belonging
        to Visa start with a "4"). In an API, each network is represented by a
        string from the [[[card-network-ids]]].

        <p class="note">
          When the end user explicitly switches from one card to another, these
          steps cause an event to fire in the [[[payment-request]]]. The
          algorithm presupposes that the user agent is only presenting
          <a>supported cards</a> to the end user, by having filtered out
          unsupported cards based on the initiating payment request's
          {{BasicCardRequest}}'s {{BasicCardRequest/supportedNetworks}} values.

          follows. The steps take {{PaymentRequest}} |request:PaymentRequest|
          as input. To mitigate fingerprinting concerns, the user agent MUST
          NOT run these steps unless a user explicitly switches to a different
          card by performing some user action (e.g., by selecting a different
          card explicitly from a list of cards). For cards that are preselected
          by default by the user agent, any matching
          {{PaymentDetailsModifier}}s <a data-lt=

                    For merchants, the resulting {{PaymentAddress}} object

        Security and Privacy Considerations
      </h2>
      <p>
        Due to differences in quality of implementation and the end user's
        ability to input data into unconstrained input fields, merchants are
        expected to revalidate all {{BasicCardResponse}} returned by APIs that
        make use of this specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, merchants need to treat the values of any <a>details</a>
        with the same scrutiny that they would apply to a [[HTML]] `input`
        element, by, for example, sanitizing all the members of a
        {{BasicCardResponse}} before rendering them anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on jurisdiction, users of this specification (implementers,
        merchants, payment processors, etc.) can be subject to <dfn data-abbr=
        "PCI DSS">Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard Compliance</dfn>
        or other regulations. Discussion of those considerations are outside
        the scope of this document.
