        The Basic Card Payment specification describes the data formats used by the
        PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]] to support payment by payment cards such as
        credit or debit cards.

        The working group maintains <a href="https://github.com/w3c/browser-payment-api/issues">a
        list of all bug reports that the group has not yet addressed</a>.
        This draft highlights some of the pending issues that are still to be discussed in the working
        group. No decision has been taken on the outcome of these issues including whether they are valid.
        Pull requests with proposed specification text for outstanding issues are strongly encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        This specification was derived from a report published previously by the
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/wicg/">Web Platform Incubator Community Group</a>.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification is a <a>Payment Method Specification</a> for use with the PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]]. With it, merchants can collect the basic card details (card holder name, card number, etc.) through the PaymentRequest API that they have traditionally collected through Web forms, but with an improved user experience.</p>
      <p class="note">The Web Payments Working Group is also investigating payment methods that offer greater security (e.g., through tokenization).</p>

    <section id="method-id">
      <h2>Payment Method Identifier</h2>
      <p>The following <a>payment method identifier</a> strings are supported by the Basic Card Payment data formats.</p>
      <p class="note"> The Web Payments Working Group is leaning toward a single identifier for basic card payments, combined with a filtering mechanism.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="init-data">
      <h2>Payment Method Specific Data for the PaymentRequest constructor</h2>
      <p>For this payment method, there is no <code>data</code> passed as input to the PaymentRequest constructor.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="response">
      <h2>Payment Method Response</h2>
      <p>The <dfn><code>BasicCardResponse</code></dfn> dictionary contains the response from the
      PaymentRequest API when a user accepts payment with a Basic Payment Card payment method.</p>

      <section>
      <h3>BasicCardResponse</h3>
      <pre class="idl">
        dictionary BasicCardResponse {
          DOMString cardholderName;
          required DOMString cardNumber;
          DOMString expiryMonth;
          DOMString expiryYear;
		  DOMString cardSecurityCode;
		  
          BillingAddress? billingAddress;
        };
      </pre>

      <p>
        The <code>BasicCardResponse</code> dictionary contains the following fields:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardholderName</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardholderName</code> field contains the cardholder's name as it appears on the card.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardNumber</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardNumber</code> field contains the primary account number (PAN) for the payment card.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>expiryMonth</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>expiryMonth</code> field contains a two-digit string for the expiry month
        of the card in the range <code>01</code> to <code>12</code>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>expiryYear</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>expiryYear</code> field contains a two-digit string for the expiry year
        of the card in the range <code>00</code> to <code>99</code>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardSecurityCode</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardSecurityCode</code> field contains a three or four digit string for the
        security code of the card (sometimes known as the CVV, CVC, CVN, CVE or CID).</dd>
     </dl>


      <p class="issue" data-number="55" title="Should the messages support field-level encryption?">For security reasons (e.g., PCI scope) the Web Payments Working Group is discussing whether field-level encryption is necessary for this
	specification, or whether that is unnecessary for this specification, which is a simple replacement for Web forms.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
      <h3>BillingAddress</h3>
      <pre class="idl">
        dictionary BillingAddress {
          // [...] fields TBC - most likely the same as shipping address
        };
      </pre>

      <p>The <dfn><code>BillingAddress</code></dfn> dictionary contains the billing address
      information associated with the payment card.</p>

      <p class="issue">
        The fields of the <code>BillingAddress</code> will most likely match those in the 
        shipping address of the PaymentRequest API once those are defined.
      </p>

      </section>
    </section>

    <div class="issue" data-number="17" title="complete() should take a string argument not boolean">
      There is an open issue about what values can be supplied to complete. These may depend on the
      payment method selected and then Basic Card Payment values would need to be defined in this
      document.
    </div>
    
    <section id="security">
      <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>Owners of web sites SHOULD NOT store the payer's card information except where warranted, such as storage for future and recurring payments. When card information is stored, web site owners SHOULD take measures to prevent its disclosure.</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Implementers may be subject to PCI DSS or other regulations, but discussion of those considerations lies outside the scope of this document.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="flow">
      <h2>Payment Method Flow</h2>
      <p>The following represent the flow for all the supported <a>payment method identifier</a> strings as they could be used by a web site</p>
      <p>The blue call-outs show where and how the API is invoked.</p>
