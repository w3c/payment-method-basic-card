      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        This specification is a Payment Method specification for use with the PaymentRequest API [[!PAYMENT-REQUEST-API]].
        With it, merchants can collect the basic card details (card holder name, card number, etc.) through the
        PaymentRequest API that they have traditionally collected through Web forms, but with an improved user experience.</p>
      <p class="note">The Web Payments Working Group is also investigating payment methods that offer greater security (e.g., through tokenization).</p>

      </dl>
    </section>

    <section id="method-id">
      <h2>Payment Method Identifier</h2>
      <p>The <a>payment method identifier</a> string for the Basic Card Payment method is <dfn><code>basic-card</code></dfn>.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="request">
      <h2>Payment Method Specific Data for the PaymentRequest constructor</h2>
      <p>This section describes payment method specific data that is supplied as part of the <code>data</code>
      argument to the <a>PaymentRequest constructor</a>.</p>

      <section>
      <h3>BasicCardRequest</h3>
      <pre class="idl">
        enum BasicCardType { "credit", "debit", "prepaid" };

        dictionary BasicCardRequest {
          sequence&lt;DOMString&gt; supportedNetworks;
          sequence&lt;BasicCardType&gt; supportedTypes;
        };
      </pre>

      <p>
        The <code>BasicCardRequest</code> dictionary contains the following fields:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn><code>supportedNetworks</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>supportedNetworks</code> field contains a sequence of identifiers for card networks
        that the merchant accepts. W3C maintains a <a href="https://www.w3.org/Payments/card-network-ids">list of approved card network identifiers</a>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>supportedTypes</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>supportedTypes</code> field contains a sequence of card types that the merchant
        accepts. Implementations will determine how to match the type values <code>credit</code>,
        <code>debit</code>, and <code>prepaid</code>.</dd>
      </dl>

      <p class="note">
        The <code>supportedNetworks</code> and <code>supportedTypes</code> fields are both optional.
        If neither is provided then any card may be returned. If only <code>supportedNetworks</code>
        is provided then any card type may be returned provided it matches one of the networks.
        If only <code>supportedTypes</code> is provided then a card may be returned from any network
        provided it matches one of the types.
      </p>

      <section>
      <h3>Processing incoming payment method data</h3>

      <p>When the PaymentRequest API is to pass data to a payment app supporting basic-card as part
      of the <a>paymentRequest.show()</a> algorithm, the payment app must process any non-null
      incoming data by deserializing it using an algorithm equivalent to that performed by
      <a>JSON.parse</a>, and then converting the resulting object to a <code>BasicCardRequest</code>
      dictionary.</p>

      <p>If these steps fail, the payment app must report that it does not support the incoming
      payment request.</p>

      <p>Otherwise, the payment app may use the fields of the resulting dictionary to determine
      whether it supports the payment request, and to carry out the payment process.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="response">
      <h2>Payment Method Response</h2>
      <p>The <dfn><code>BasicCardResponse</code></dfn> dictionary contains the response from the
      PaymentRequest API when a user accepts payment with a Basic Payment Card payment method.</p>

      <section>
      <h3>BasicCardResponse</h3>
      <pre class="idl">
        dictionary BasicCardResponse {
          DOMString cardholderName;
          required DOMString cardNumber;
          DOMString expiryMonth;
          DOMString expiryYear;
		      DOMString cardSecurityCode;

          PaymentAddress? billingAddress;
        };
      </pre>

      <p>
        The <code>BasicCardResponse</code> dictionary contains the following fields:
      </p>

      <dl>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardholderName</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardholderName</code> field contains the cardholder's name as it appears on the card.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardNumber</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardNumber</code> field contains the primary account number (PAN) for the payment card.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>expiryMonth</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>expiryMonth</code> field contains a two-digit string for the expiry month
        of the card in the range <code>01</code> to <code>12</code>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>expiryYear</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>expiryYear</code> field contains a four-digit string for the expiry year
        of the card in the range <code>0000</code> to <code>9999</code>.</dd>
        <dt><dfn><code>cardSecurityCode</code></dfn></dt>
        <dd>The <code>cardSecurityCode</code> field contains a three or four digit string for the
        security code of the card (sometimes known as the CVV, CVC, CVN, CVE or CID).</dd>
      </dl>

      </section>

      <section>
        <h3>Providing outgoing payment responses</h3>

        <p>When the <a>user accepts the payment request algorithm</a> runs in the context of a
        payment app supporting basic-card, the payment app must provide back the relevant data in a
        <code>BasicCardResponse</code> dictionary.</p>
      </section>
    </section>

    <section id="security">
      <h2>Security and Privacy Considerations</h2>

      <p>Owners of web sites SHOULD NOT store the payer's card information except where warranted, such as storage for future and recurring payments. When card information is stored, web site owners SHOULD take measures to prevent its disclosure.</p>

      <p><strong>Note</strong>: Implementers may be subject to PCI DSS or other regulations, but discussion of those considerations lies outside the scope of this document.</p>
